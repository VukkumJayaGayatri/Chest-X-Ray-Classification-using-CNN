# Chest X-Ray Image Classification Using CNN

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify chest X-ray images. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.5%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying medical conditions from X-ray scans.

## Features
- Utilizes CNNs for efficient feature extraction and classification.
- Implements data preprocessing techniques to handle image datasets.
- Trains and evaluates the model with high accuracy.
- Provides insights into model performance with evaluation metrics and visualizations.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Resizes and normalizes X-ray images for consistency.
    - Augments data to enhance model robustness.
2. **Model Architecture**:
    - Designed a deep CNN model optimized for image classification.
3. **Training**:
    - Trains the model using a labeled dataset of chest X-rays.
4. **Evaluation**:
    - Evaluates model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.
5. **Results**:
    - Achieves a classification accuracy of 98.5%.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the framework used in the code)
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, OpenCV, Scikit-learn

## Dataset
